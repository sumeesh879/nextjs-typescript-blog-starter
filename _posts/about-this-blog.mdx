## Introduction

This blog starter project is build using [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind](http://tailwindcss.com/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

Most of the syntax highlighting CSS code is taken from leerob's blog setting. Please refer to his blog more advanced usecases.
This is just a simple Nextjs blog example with `typescript`, `tailwindcss` and `MDX` support.

Light and Dark themes are supported through tailwind v2.0. Current theme is defaulted to user's system preference.

### Code Example

```jsx
export const HelloComponent = () => {
  return <h2>Hello component !</h2>;
};
```
